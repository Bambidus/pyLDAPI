decoration:
@register -- provide alternates view and register view, because these two views are required by any category and instances, even root path, it should be extended by all of them.
@category (extends @register, give it a name: site)
@sub-category (extends @register, belongs @category(site), give it a name: sub-site)
@instance (extends @register, belongs @category(site) or @sub-category(sub-site))


		

		
Route define:
@routes.route('/')
@register() # default root path
def index():
	conf = conf()
	conf.default = 'reg'
	conf[]

@routes.route('/site')
@register(rander=customer_rander)


@instance({category:site})
@routes.route('/site/<id>')

@sub-category({name: sub-site, parent:site})
@routes.route('/site/sub-site')

@instance({category:sub-site})
@routes.route('/site/sub-site/<id>')


How to go crossing the website?
1. @register decoration adds alternates and regester views to all routes, 
2. @category, @sub-categories extends @register
3. using URL/_view=alternates&_format=application/json can acquire current register views and alternates view, 
4. at the same time, using register.__subclasses__() to get all categories as a tree and return them as the categories the system support. 
5. In the testing, I can access these categories using alternates view in application/json format, and go cross categories and pick up an instance each of them.
5. since at any category, sub-category and instance, I could easily access any information or data as I wish.
 
class conf:
	__init__(self):
		self = map()
		self.default = 'reg'
	@property
	def view():
		return self.keys()
